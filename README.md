## Reviews App

Build using ideas from the golang [standard project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)

Directory structuring is left out to developers

Requirements:
- go v1.15

Running:
- `make test` to run specs
- `make build.server` to build server
- `./out/server start` to start
